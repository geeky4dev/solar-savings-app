# solar-savings-app
Web app where users input their monthly electricity usage, electricity price, and solar energy production   
to estimate how much they could save by installing solar panels., the project is running locally (not dockerized)    
to facilitate the design.    

It uses following technologies:    

✅ Flask App for backend  
✅ React (Vite) and Bootstrap for frontend  

🔹 Functionalities:    
✅ Receives user input.  
✅ Calls the backend via the /calculate API.  
✅ Displays estimated monthly savings.  
✅ Form with validated fields (does not accept empty or ≤ 0 values).  
✅ Elegant design thanks to Bootstrap.  
✅ Red alerts for errors and green alerts for successful results.

🚀 Development Step by Step    

Step 1️⃣: Configuring Development Environment  
Before installing Flask, ensure Python and pip are up to date (Terminal Linux):     
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y    
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y    

Step 2️⃣: Create directories in your Project folder  
cd Projects  
mkdir solar-savings-app/backend  

Open VS Code (or other) and navigate to your Project directory:  
code .  

Step 3️⃣: Create app.py  (/backend)   

Step 4️⃣: Create Virtual Environment (recommended)   
Using a virtual environment helps avoid conflicts between dependencies:    

cd backend  
python3 -m venv venv       # For Linux/Mac    
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac     
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows   

==> Inside the virtual environment (Linux), install Flask:   
pip install Flask     

Step 5️⃣:  Create a project React (Vite) for the frontend  
cd ..  
npm create vite@latest frontend --template react  

Choose a Framework and a Variant (e.g React and JavaScript) an install NPM (Node Package Manager):  
cd frontend  
npm install  

Step 6️⃣:  Add following Proxy to the default vite.config.js   
export default {  
...server: {  
....proxy: {  
......'/calcular': 'http://localhost:5001'  
.....}  
...}  
})  

Step 7️⃣:  Edit the App.jsx  

Step 8️⃣:  Run the app  
In Terminal #1: Activate Virtual Environment  
cd backend  
source venv/bin/activate   # ✅ Linux / WSL  

==> Install Flask inside the venv (Only for the first time)  
pip install flask flask-cors  

==> Run the backend with Flask  
python3 app.py  

Step 9️⃣:  Run the development server on JavaScript/Node.js (with frameworks React, Vite).    
In Terminal #2:   
cd frontend  
npm run dev  

Step 9️⃣:  Open the browser with http://localhost:5173 and try some questions (please see dictionaries on app.py)  

🔹 Summary    
✅ Flask is used to build the web application (the logic in the backend).    
✅ React is the engine of your frontend UI, the main tool used to build the user interface (UI) of the web application.  
✅ Vite is the environment you develop in — fast, modern, and super smooth.  
✅ Virtual environment keeps dependencies organized.
